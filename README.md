# How to Use

1. Open the application
2. View the qoutes
3. If you want to see a new qoute click the "Refresh Qoute" Button

# Bonus Features

- If you close the application and reopen the application you will be able to see a new Wallpaper behind the qoute at random intervals.

# Road-Blocks Encountered

- Implementing "Refresh Qoute" Button
  - RandomInt generator and State Refresher was needed to know how to trigger a new int being called for a new qoute and then connecting the button to the qoute in the box directly.
